# BingoCards
[LaTeX](http://tug.org/) and [python](http://www.python.org)-powered randomized bingo cards with custom cells. 
Takes a user-supplied list of phrases and randomly assigns them to a user-specified number of bingo cards, using LaTeX. 
A python script creates a complete checklist for all possible bingo card cells. 
This project is ideal for televised political events like State of the Union or presidential [or primary] debates.

Although I made some changes to the LaTeX code, the bulk of the code -- and all of the hard stuff -- 
was taken from [tex.stackexchange.com](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/63357/automatically-generated-bingo-cards).

## Basic Usage
1. Update bingolist.tex with the list of words you want randomly distributed in bingo tiles
2. Update bingocards.tex path to bingolist.txt, card title, and free space image.
3. Compile bingocards.tex to get bingo cards
4. Run ```shell
       python makechecklist.py
       ```
       to update master checklist

## Introduction

The list of phrases (and don't make any individual phrase very long) 
needs to be semicolon-separated text, with a small bit of LaTeX 
encompassing the list. You can make the list about anything; I have
added a vice-presidential list too, but the relevant words will always
change.

```LaTeX
\myItems{Believe me;
Make America Great Again;
Build a Wall;
Benghazi;
Crooked Hillary;
% [et cetera]
% note comments are allowed, as is whitespace
We don't \emph{win} anymore
}
```

:exclamation: **Important:** the list of items must _not_ include a final semicolon.
 LaTeX interprets a final semicolon to mean "the next entry is a blank", 
 and you will end up with randomly empty cells on the bingo cards.
The list should terminate only with a close-brace, though the brace can be on a new line.

The LaTeX file, when run, will take the list, pick 24 at random 
(the "Free Space" is humorously listed as _"Candidate Talks Past Allotted Time"_, 
as though that could ever _not_ happen), and assign them to a 
standard 5 x 5 bingo card. This random process is nice because it avoids 
"sets" of cards all providing Bingo at the same time. 

The LaTeX file includes a for-loop to create some number (initially set at 50) of PDF cards. 

## Customizing the Code

The bingo cards also include a small label below the bingo grid, so customize the ```\biglabel``` macro to suit your event.

```LaTeX
% make a nice identifier for the card (in case, say, there is more than one
% presidential debate, etc.)
\newcommand{\biglabel}{\vspace{0.2in}\begin{center}
\begin{LARGE}
Some Bingo Event

State of the Union

01 January 1900

\end{LARGE}
\end{center}
}
```

If you want to use an arbitrary "Free Space" label, you can change the 
[TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) code:

```LaTeX
\node [scale=1.2] at ($(\col,-\row)-(0.5,0.3)$) {Something};
\node [scale=1.2] at ($(\col,-\row)-(0.5,0.5)$) {Else};
\node [scale=1.2] at ($(\col,-\row)-(0.5,0.7)$) {Entirely};
```

And note there is a `\renewcommand` or two you can uncomment for either a 
totally generic "Free Space" square, or a blindingly obvious topic/comment.

For those wholly new to TikZ, the second number of the pair is a y-coordinate 
for the line, and a line space of 0.2 is about right.
If you trim the cell to two lines, you will want to change the y-values 
to be more centered. 

## The Master Checklist

The python script parses the entire list and provides a ```longtable``` 
checklist for the moderator to use when evaluating a given event. 
The ```bingochecklist.tex``` file reads the output of the python script, 
which is a file called ```checklist1.tex```.

So, from a terminal on your machine of choice, run 

```shell
python makechecklist.py
```

And if you've got all the files where they are supposed to be, it will 
form up the guts of the checklist. 
Next, compile ```bingochecklist.tex``` a few times and you'll be good to go. 
You need to compile the TeX file at least twice because it uses 
```longtable```, and column widths are determined dynamically over 
the course of a few LaTeX compiles.
